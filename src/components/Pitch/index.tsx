      I have a strong experience in management and software engineering, focus
      on architecture and innovation. I’m passionate about learning and
      teaching, and that’s why I think that knowledge doesn’t belong to anyone,
      so it must be shared with others. My goal is to keep growing and learning
      about business and product development to reach people and satisfy their
      needs.
